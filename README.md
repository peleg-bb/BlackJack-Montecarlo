# BlackJack Montecarlo
In this project I implemented Gymnasium's BlackJack Problem - https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/blackjack/
We use agent-based reinforcement learning to train the model to optimally play BlackJack.

This was part of the Reinforcement Learning course, a voluntary master's course I took as part of my Bachelor's of Software Engineering at Ben Gurion University.
